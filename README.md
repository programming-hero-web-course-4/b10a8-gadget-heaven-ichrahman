## **React Fundamentals Used**

This project employs several core React concepts, including:

1. **Components**: Reusable components such as `Navbar`, `Cart`, `DevicesDetails`, and `Footer`.  
2. **Props**: Passing data between components efficiently.  
3. **State Management**: Utilizing the `useState` hook to manage state (e.g., cart items, wishlist).  
4. **Context API**: Managing global state for cart and wishlist to allow data sharing across components.  
5. **Routing**: Using `react-router-dom` for navigation and dynamic routes like `/devices/:deviceId`.  

## **Data Handling & Management**

- **Context API**: Used for managing and sharing global state such as the shopping cart and wishlist across multiple components.


## **Features**

1. **Dynamic Product Details**:
   - Displays detailed product information, including price, description, specifications, and ratings.
   
2. **Cart and Wishlist Functionality**:
   - Add, remove, and manage items in the cart or wishlist dynamically.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Fully responsive layout designed for seamless use across devices.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - A 404 error page for undefined routes to improve user experience.

5. **Interactive Toast Notifications**:
   - Integrated with `react-toastify` to display real-time feedback for user actions (e.g., adding/removing items from the cart).
